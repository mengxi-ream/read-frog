## Getting Started

Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.

# Clone the repository from your fork
git clone https://github.com/xxxxx/read-frog.git

# Enter the project directory
cd read-frog

# Start the project
pnpm dev
```

<Callout title="window environment variable configuration">
  If you are currently in a Windows environment, you need to add a `web-ext.config.ts` file in the `apps/extension` directory to explicitly specify the browser path.  
  ```javascript
  // apps/extension/web-ext.config.ts
  import { defineWebExtConfig } from 'wxt';

  export default defineWebExtConfig({
    binaries: {
        chrome: "path/to/your/chrome.exe",
        firefox: "path/to/your/firefox.exe",
        edge: "path/to/your/edge.exe"
	  }
  });
  ```
</Callout>

<Callout title="pnpm dev can't load the extension automatically">
  If you use Chrome version 137 or higher, you need to download [Chrome for
  Testing](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-for-testing/) for
  development. See
  [details](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/browser-startup.html).

## Submitting Code

### Create a new branch

```bash
# For new features
git checkout -b feat/the-feature

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/the-bug

# For docs modify
git checkout -b docs/the-docs
```

### Merge Branch

If the remote main branch gets updated and creates conflicts in our PR, you can resolve it by merging the remote branch in advance
.

```bash 
// Switch to the main branch
git checkout main

// Pull the latest code from upstream
git pull upstream main

// Switch back to your local branch
git checkout docs/xxxx

// Merge the main branch into your local branch
git rebase main

// Push Your Code
git push origin docs/xxxx
```

<Callout title="Fatal in syncing the upstream repository">
  If you encounter this error while syncing the upstream repository
  ```bash
  fatal: 'upstream' does not appear to be a git repository
  fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
  ```
  Please try to manually add an upstream repository 
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/mengxi-ream/read-frog
  ```
</Callout>

## Generating Pull Request

Before generating a Pull Request, your need to add a changeset

```bash
# Add Changeset
pnpm changeset

# Choose Packages
# Which packages would you like to include?...
[] @read-frog/website
[] @read-frog/extension

# Select a appropriate bump type for above packages
# Which packages should have a major bump? (major)
( ) all packages
  ( ) @read-frog/website@0.1.0
  ( ) @read-frog/extension@0.1.0
# Which packages should have a minor bump? (minor)
( ) all packages
  ( ) @read-frog/website@0.1.0
  ( ) @read-frog/extension@0.1.0
# The following packages will be patch bumped (patch)
( ) all packages
  ( ) @read-frog/website@0.1.0
  ( ) @read-frog/extension@0.1.0

# Commit Summary
Summary >> ....
```

`pnpm changeset` will generate `[uniqId].md` in the `.changeset` file, and the description of this changeset can be adjusted again after the generation is completed.

Then create a Pull Request and wait for it to be merged.

## Commit Convention

We use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for writing commit messages.

## Skip Google API Tests in China

If you are a contributor from mainland China, when you need to push code, use the following command:

```bash
// MAC
SKIP_FREE_API=true git push

// WINDOWS
$env:SKIP_FREE_API='true'
git push
```

Why is this necessary? Because code tests are performed during the push process, but Google's free API is inaccessible in mainland China. This would cause the tests to fail and the push to be rejected. By setting the `SKIP_FREE_API` environment variable, we skip the Google tests.
